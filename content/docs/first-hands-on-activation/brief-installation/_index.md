## Step 1 — Preparing Yourself and Your Physical Space

- Choose a **quiet, private location**
    
- Avoid public or shared environments
    
- Remove or power off:
    
    - Mobile phones
        
    - Smart watches
        
    - Smart speakers
        
    - Tablets and smart TVs
        
- Physically cover:
    
    - Laptop webcams
        
    - External cameras
        
- Assume microphones are always active
    
- Disconnect unnecessary peripherals
    
- Adopt the correct mindset:
    
    - This session is for learning, not doing
        
    - Move slowly and deliberately
        
    - Do not assume safety by default
        

* * *

## Step 2 — Establishing a Trusted System Foundation

- Select a **dedicated USB drive**
    
- Use the USB **only for Tails OS**
    
- Never:
    
    - Share the USB
        
    - Reuse it for personal files
        
    - Plug it into untrusted systems
        
- Download Tails OS **only from the official source**
    
- Verify the downloaded file before use
    
- Write Tails to the USB carefully and without interruption
    
- Treat the USB as a **sensitive identity object**
    

* * *

## Step 3 — Booting Into a Controlled, Isolated Environment

- Power off the computer completely
    
- Insert the Tails USB
    
- Use the boot menu to start from USB
    
- Bypass the normal operating system entirely
    
- Handle Secure Boot or firmware prompts calmly
    
- Confirm success when:
    
    - Tails loads
        
    - The normal OS does not appear
        
- Understand:
    
    - The session is isolated
        
    - The system is temporary by design
        

* * *

## Step 4 — Initial System Setup and Network Readiness

- Select correct:
    
    - Language
        
    - Keyboard layout
        
- Avoid advanced or unfamiliar configuration options
    
- Allow Tails to finish loading fully
    
- Prepare network hardware:
    
    - Use a supported external network adapter or internal Wi-Fi (if external network adapter is not present)
- Confirm:
    
    - Wi-Fi is enabled
        
    - Networks are visible
        
- Avoid modifying advanced network settings
    

* * *

## Step 5 — Understanding the Network and Connecting to Tor

- Identify the network type:
    
    - Public
        
    - Private
        
- Understand that routers can:
    
    - See connections
        
    - Not see Tor-encrypted content
        
- Handle captive portals if present
    
- Connect to Wi-Fi only when it behaves normally
    
- Allow Tor to:
    
    - Initialize
        
    - Synchronize time
        
    - Complete bootstrapping
        
- Expect:
    
    - Delays
        
    - Slowness
        
- Open Tor Browser only after Tor is fully connected
    

* * *

## Step 6 — Safe Browsing Posture and System Awareness

- Confirm Tor Browser shows a Tor connection message
    
- Keep security settings at default
    
- Do **not**:
    
    - Log into any accounts
        
    - Reuse usernames
        
    - Enter personal information
        
    - Perform transactions
        
- Treat the session as a **temporary anonymous identity**
    
- Explore the desktop cautiously:
    
    - Do not open random applications
        
    - Use only Tor-aware tools
        
- Understand:
    
    - Data is not saved by default
        
    - Many tools are for later stages
        

* * *

## Step 7 — Learning About Persistence, Identity, and Fingerprinting

- Understand Persistent Storage:
    
    - Saves data across sessions
        
    - Creates continuity
        
    - Increases identity exposure
        
- Learn about cryptographic keys:
    
    - Keys represent identity
        
    - Saving keys links sessions together
        
- Learn about wallets:
    
    - Carry real financial risk
        
    - Persistence increases exposure
        
- Avoid enabling persistence unnecessarily
    
- Avoid customizing:
    
    - Time or timezone
        
    - Language or fonts
        
    - Screen resolution
        
- Prefer defaults to blend in

## Step 8 — Observation, Discipline, and Clean Shutdown

- Keep the first session:
    
    - Short
        
    - Observational
        
- When browsing:
    
    - Move slowly
        
    - Expect broken links
        
    - Treat sites with skepticism
        
- Avoid:
    
    - Downloads
        
    - Logins
        
    - Interactions
        
- Stop immediately if something feels wrong
    
- End the session cleanly:
    
    - Close applications
        
    - Shut down normally
        
    - Remove USB only after power-off
        
- Reflect briefly:
    
    - What worked
        
    - What was unclear
        
    - What to improve next time
