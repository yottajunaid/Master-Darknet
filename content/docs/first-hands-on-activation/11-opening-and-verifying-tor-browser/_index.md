title: "11\. Opening and Verifying Tor Browser"
---

- ## Step 1: Browser Launch Sequence
    
    - Find the **Tor Browser** icon on the desktop or menu.
        
    - Click it **once**.
        
    - Wait patiently.
        
    
    What you may see:
    
    - A loading window
        
    - A short delay before the browser opens
        
    
    Do not:
    
    - Click multiple times
        
    - Force close it if it feels slow
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Tor Browser may take time to open—this is normal.

    ## Step 2: Tor Connectivity Confirmation
    
    When the browser opens:
    
    - You should see a **Tor welcome page**
        
    - It usually says something like:
        
        - “Connected to the Tor Network”
    
    This confirms:
    
    - Tor is working
        
    - Your browser is using Tor properly
        
    
    If you see:
    
    - Normal search engines immediately
        
    - Errors saying “Not connected”
        
    
    Then:
    
    - Tor may not be ready yet
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    The welcome page means Tor is active.

    ## Step 3: Security Level Awareness
    
    Tor Browser has **security levels**.
    
    Important to know:
    
    - Higher security = fewer features
        
    - Lower security = more features
        
    
    For beginners:
    
    - Do not change security levels immediately
        
    - Use default settings first
        
    
    Changing settings without understanding can:
    
    - Break websites
        
    - Cause confusion
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Default security is fine for first use.

    ## Step 4: First Identity Context
    
    When Tor Browser opens:
    
    - You are using a **temporary identity**
        
    - This identity:
        
        - Is not your real identity
            
        - Exists only for this session
            
    
    Important behavior:
    
    - Do not log in to personal accounts
        
    - Do not type real names or emails
        
    - Treat this as a fresh, unknown user
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    You are anonymous—keep it that way.

    ## Step 5: Browser State Validation
    
    Before browsing:
    
    - Look at the browser window
        
    - Confirm:
        
        - Tor icon is visible
            
        - No warning messages appear
            
        - Page loads normally
            
    
    If something feels wrong:
    
    - Do not continue
        
    - Close the browser
        
    - Check Tor connection again
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Make sure everything looks normal before moving forward.

    ## Step 6: Ready for Navigation
    
    Once confirmed:
    
    - You are ready to:
        
        - Visit websites
            
        - Use search engines
            
    - Start slow
        
    - Avoid random clicking
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Confirm first, browse second.
