- ## Step 1: Observed Technical Issues
    
    First, think about **technical problems** that happened.
    
    Examples:
    
    - USB did not boot on first try
        
    - Wi-Fi took time to connect
        
    - Tor was slow or failed once
        
    - Browser froze or felt slow
        
    
    Important understanding:
    
    - These problems are **normal**
        
    - They happen to many users
        
    - They do not mean failure
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Technical problems are part of learning.

    ## Step 2: Trainee Behavioral Mistakes
    
    Next, think about **human mistakes**, not system problems.
    
    Common beginner mistakes:
    
    - Clicking too fast
        
    - Not reading messages carefully
        
    - Trying to do too much in one session
        
    - Getting curious and opening random links
        
    
    Important mindset:
    
    - Mistakes are learning points
        
    - They should be noticed, not hidden
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    People make more mistakes than computers.

    ## Step 3: Environmental Weak Points
    
    Now think about the **physical environment**.
    
    Ask questions like:
    
    - Was the room quiet and private?
        
    - Were phones or smart devices nearby?
        
    - Was the setup rushed?
        
    - Were there distractions?
        
    
    Why this matters:
    
    - Many risks start outside the computer
        
    - Environment affects focus and safety
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Bad surroundings create bad decisions.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 4: Anonymity Assumption Corrections
    
    Many beginners believe things like:
    
    - “Tor makes me invisible”
        
    - “Nothing can go wrong”
        
    - “Defaults mean fully safe”
        
    
    This step is about correcting those ideas.
    
    Reality:
    
    - Tor reduces risk, it does not remove it
        
    - Behavior still matters
        
    - Small mistakes still count
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Tor helps, but it is not magic.

    ## Step 5: Readiness for Advanced Labs
    
    Finally, decide if the learner is ready to move forward.
    
    Signs of readiness:
    
    - Calm behavior
        
    - Patience during problems
        
    - Understanding of basic flow
        
    - Respect for discipline
        
    
    Signs of not being ready:
    
    - Rushing
        
    - Overconfidence
        
    - Ignoring warnings
        
    - Skipping steps
        
    
    Important rule:
    
    - Speed does not mean readiness
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Being careful is more important than being fast.

    ## Step 6: First-Day Learning Summary
    
    End the debrief by summarizing:
    
    - What went well
        
    - What was confusing
        
    - What needs practice
        
    - What should not be repeated
        
    
    This builds:
    
    - Awareness
        
    - Confidence
        
    - Better habits for next labs
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Review today so tomorrow is better.
