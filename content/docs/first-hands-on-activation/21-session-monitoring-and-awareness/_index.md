- ## Step 1: Tor Circuit Change Events
    
    While browsing, **Tor** may change its path automatically.
    
    You may notice:
    
    - Pages reload suddenly
        
    - A site stops loading and then works again
        
    - Slight delays without warning
        
    
    This is normal because:
    
    - Tor changes routes to stay safe
    
    What to do:
    
    - Do nothing
        
    - Just wait or refresh once
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Sudden reloads usually mean Tor changed its path.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 2: Network Drop Recognition
    
    Sometimes the internet connection drops.
    
    Signs:
    
    - Pages stop loading
        
    - Tor Browser shows connection messages
        
    - Network icon changes
        
    
    What this means:
    
    - Wi-Fi may be unstable
        
    - Network may have disconnected briefly
        
    
    What to do:
    
    - Stop clicking
        
    - Wait
        
    - Check if the network reconnects
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    No internet = stop and wait.

    ## Step 3: Browser Freeze and Leak Risks
    
    Sometimes the browser may:
    
    - Freeze
        
    - Become unresponsive
        
    - Feel “stuck”
        
    
    Important:
    
    - Do not panic
        
    - Do not start opening other apps
        
    - Do not force random actions
        
    
    Why this matters:
    
    - Panic clicking causes mistakes
        
    - Calm response reduces risk
        
    
    If freeze continues:
    
    - Close the browser safely
        
    - End the session if unsure
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    If the browser freezes, stay calm and stop.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 4: Unexpected Traffic Behavior
    
    Watch for things that feel strange, such as:
    
    - Pages loading unusually fast
        
    - Many pop-ups
        
    - Automatic redirects
        
    - Requests to download files
        
    
    These are warning signs.
    
    What to do:
    
    - Do not click further
        
    - Close the tab
        
    - Leave the site
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    If something feels strange, leave the page.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 5: Alert Interpretation
    
    Tor Browser or the system may show alerts.
    
    Alerts may say:
    
    - Connection problem
        
    - Security warning
        
    - Network issue
        
    
    Important habits:
    
    - Read alerts carefully
        
    - Do not ignore them
        
    - Do not blindly click “OK”
        
    
    If you do not understand the alert:
    
    - Stop
        
    - End the session if needed
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Alerts are there to warn you—pay attention.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 6: Knowing When to Stop
    
    You should consider stopping the session when:
    
    - Too many errors happen
        
    - Network keeps dropping
        
    - Browser behaves oddly
        
    - You feel unsure or uncomfortable
        
    
    Stopping early is **not failure**.
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Stopping is safer than pushing forward.
