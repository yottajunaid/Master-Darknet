title: "5\. Initial Tails Startup and Welcome Screen"
---

- ## Step 1: Language and Keyboard Context
    
    - The first screen lets you choose:
        
        - Language
            
        - Keyboard layout
            
    - Choose the language you are comfortable reading.
        
    - Choose the keyboard that matches your physical keyboard.
        
    
    Example:
    
    - US keyboard vs UK keyboard
        
    - English vs another language
        
    
    Why this matters:
    
    - Wrong keyboard = wrong keys
        
    - Passwords may type incorrectly
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Pick the language and keyboard that match you.

    ## Step 2: Regional Settings Awareness
    
    You may see options related to:
    
    - Region
        
    - Location
        
    - Time-related settings
        
    
    Important things to understand:
    
    - These settings can affect:
        
        - Time display
            
        - Language format
            
    - You do **not** need to customize everything
        
    - Default settings are usually safe for beginners
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Do not over-change settings if you are not sure.

    ## Step 3: Network Configuration Prompt Review
    
    Tails may ask about:
    
    - Network connection
        
    - How it should connect to the internet
        
    
    At this stage:
    
    - Read the screen slowly
        
    - Do not rush
        
    - Understand what is being asked before clicking
        
    
    You may see:
    
    - Automatic connection options
        
    - Advanced options (for later use)
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    This screen decides how Tails will reach the internet.

    ## Step 4: Unsafe Default Recognition
    
    Not all defaults are bad, but:
    
    - Some defaults are made for convenience
        
    - Not all are made for high caution users
        
    
    What to do:
    
    - Avoid enabling things you do not understand
        
    - Do not click “extra” options just to explore
        
    - Stay minimal during first run
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    If you don’t understand an option, leave it alone.

    ## Step 5: First-Run Threat Surface (Basic Awareness)
    
    This is the moment when:
    
    - The system becomes active
        
    - Network connections may begin
        
    - User choices start to matter
        
    
    Common beginner mistakes:
    
    - Clicking fast without reading
        
    - Enabling features unnecessarily
        
    - Assuming everything is safe by default
        
    
    Best mindset:
    
    - Slow
        
    - Careful
        
    - Observant
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    The first screen sets the tone for the whole session.

    ## Step 6: Proceeding After Welcome Screen
    
    After confirming settings:
    
    - Continue to the desktop
        
    - Do not open random applications yet
        
    - Let the system finish loading
        
    
    Once desktop appears:
    
    - You are ready for the next steps (network, Tor, browser)
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Finish setup first, explore later.
