- ## Step 1: Default Start Page Review
    
    - When Tor Browser opens, it shows a **start page**
        
    - This page usually:
        
        - Confirms Tor is working
            
        - Gives basic tips
            
    - Do not rush past it
        
    
    What to do:
    
    - Read the page calmly
        
    - Make sure it says you are connected to Tor
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    The start page tells you Tor is ready.

    ## Step 2: Unsafe URL Recognition
    
    Not every link is safe.
    
    Be careful of:
    
    - Random links from unknown sources
        
    - Shortened links
        
    - Links sent by strangers
        
    - Links copied from comments without context
        
    
    Good habit:
    
    - Only open links from trusted lists or sources
        
    - If unsure, don’t click
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    If you don’t trust the link, don’t open it.

    ## Step 3: Clear-Net vs Onion Distinction
    
    There are two types of websites:
    
    ### Clear-net websites:
    
    - Normal websites
        
    - End with things like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`
        
    - Still accessible through Tor Browser
        
    
    ### Onion websites:
    
    - End with `.onion`
        
    - Only open inside Tor Browser
        
    - Designed for Tor network
        
    
    Important:
    
    - Onion sites are **not normal websites**
        
    - They behave differently
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    `.onion` means Tor-only website.

    ## Step 4: HTTPS Indicators on Onion Services
    
    Some onion sites show:
    
    - A lock icon
        
    - “https” text
        
    
    What to understand:
    
    - Onion sites already use encryption
        
    - HTTPS adds another layer
        
    - Lack of HTTPS does not always mean unsafe
        
    
    Do not assume:
    
    - Lock icon = fully trustworthy
        
    - No lock = always dangerous
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Encryption exists, but trust still matters.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 5: Clone Site Awareness
    
    Many onion sites are **copied or fake**.
    
    Clone sites may:
    
    - Look exactly like real ones
        
    - Use similar names
        
    - Try to trick users
        
    
    Warning signs:
    
    - Different address than expected
        
    - Asking for sensitive info too early
        
    - Strange behavior
        
    
    Best habit:
    
    - Double-check onion addresses
        
    - Bookmark trusted sites carefully
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Fake sites copy real ones to fool users.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 6: First Navigation Behavior
    
    When visiting your first onion site:
    
    - Move slowly
        
    - Read before clicking
        
    - Avoid downloads
        
    - Avoid logins
        
    
    This first session is for:
    
    - Observation
        
    - Familiarity
        
    - Learning how pages look and behave
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Look first, act later.
