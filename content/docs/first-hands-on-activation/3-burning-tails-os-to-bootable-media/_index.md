- ## Step 1: Image Acquisition from Official Sources"


    Download **Tails OS** only from its **official website**
    
    - Do not download Tails from:
        
        - Random websites
            
        - YouTube links
            
        - File-sharing sites
            
    - Make sure:
        
        - The website address is correct
            
        - The page looks official
            
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Always get Tails from its real website, not from others.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 2: Integrity and Authenticity Validation
    
    This step is about **checking if the file is real and not changed**.
    
    - After download, the file must be **verified**
        
    - **<img src="../_resources/d3de247ecb7065ef3f7472cd2799c4f2.png" alt="d3de247ecb7065ef3f7472cd2799c4f2.png" width="476" height="358" class="jop-noMdConv">**
        
    - Verification helps confirm:
        
        - The file is complete
            
        - The file is not fake
            
        - The file was not modified
            
    - Do not skip this step, even if:
        
        - The download worked
            
        - The file opened normally
            
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Just because a file opens does not mean it is safe.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 3: Write Process (Burning) Completion Verification
    
    - Use the recommended tool to write Tails to the USB
        
    - Wait until the process:
        
        - Fully finishes
            
        - Shows “completed” or “successful”
            
    - Do not:
        
        - Remove the USB early
            
        - Close the program in the middle
            
        - Use the computer heavily during writing
            
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Let the USB writing finish fully without interruption.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 4: Media Readability Testing
    
    After burning:
    
    - Remove the USB safely
        
    - Plug it back in
        
    - Check that:
        
        - The USB is detected
            
        - Files are visible (if applicable)
            
    - Later, test by:
        
        - Trying to boot a system using this USB
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Make sure the USB can actually be read and used.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 5: Failure Pattern Recognition
    
    Sometimes things go wrong. Learn to notice signs like:
    
    - Writing process fails or freezes
        
    - USB not detected after writing
        
    - System does not boot from USB
        
    - Error messages during startup
        
    
    If any of these happen:
    
    - Stop using the USB
        
    - Do not try to “force” it
        
    - Re-burn Tails or change the USB
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    If something looks wrong, don’t ignore it—start again.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 6: Final Confirmation Before Booting
    
    Before moving to the next step:
    
    - Confirm:
        
        - Tails file was downloaded correctly
            
        - Verification was done
            
        - USB writing finished properly
            
        - USB looks readable
            
    
    Only after this:
    
    - Proceed to booting the computer from USB
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Check once more before using the USB to start the system.
