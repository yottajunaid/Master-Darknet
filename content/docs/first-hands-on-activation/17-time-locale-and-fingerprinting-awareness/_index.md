title: "17\. Time, Locale, and Fingerprinting Awareness"
---

- ## Step 1: System Clock Behavior
    
    - Every computer keeps track of **time**
        
    - Websites and networks can notice:
        
        - If time looks normal
            
        - If time looks strange or incorrect
            
    
    In **Tails OS**:
    
    - Time is handled carefully
        
    - Users usually do **not** need to change it
        
    
    Important habit:
    
    - Do not manually change system time unless you know why
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Wrong time can make your system stand out.

    ## Step 2: Timezone Normalization
    
    A timezone shows **where in the world you might be**.
    
    Important things to know:
    
    - Timezone can hint at location
        
    - Tails tries to avoid revealing this
        
    - Changing timezones manually can create patterns
        
    
    Beginner rule:
    
    - Leave timezone settings as they are
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Changing timezones can reveal clues about you.

    ## Step 3: Language and Font Fingerprinting
    
    Language settings affect:
    
    - Menu language
        
    - Website language
        
    - Fonts used by the system
        
    
    Why this matters:
    
    - Rare language + rare fonts = easier to recognize
        
    - Common settings blend in better
        
    
    Beginner advice:
    
    - Use common languages
        
    - Avoid customizing fonts or language styles
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Unusual language settings make you noticeable.

    ## Step 4: Screen Resolution Effects
    
    Screen resolution means:
    
    - Size of your screen
        
    - How sharp things look
        
    
    Websites can sometimes detect:
    
    - Screen size
        
    - Window size
        
    
    Important understanding:
    
    - Very rare screen sizes stand out
        
    - Default sizes blend in
        
    
    Beginner habit:
    
    - Avoid changing resolution unnecessarily
        
    - Avoid custom window sizes
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Odd screen sizes can identify a device.

    ## Step 5: Hardware Entropy Signals (Basic Idea)
    
    Every computer behaves a little differently.
    
    Things that can differ:
    
    - Hardware speed
        
    - Random number behavior
        
    - Device responses
        
    
    This creates a **hardware pattern**.
    
    Important:
    
    - Users cannot fully control this
        
    - Tails reduces this risk automatically
        
    
    User responsibility:
    
    - Avoid installing extra software
        
    - Avoid hardware changes mid-session
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Your computer has a “behavior style.”

    ## Step 6: Beginner Fingerprinting Mindset
    
    For first hands-on sessions:
    
    - Do not customize unnecessarily
        
    - Use defaults
        
    - Avoid “tweaking” settings
        
    
    Good habit:
    
    - Simple setup
        
    - Consistent behavior
        
    - Minimal changes
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    The less you change, the less you stand out.
