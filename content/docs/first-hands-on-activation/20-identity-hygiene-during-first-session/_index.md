- ## Step 1: No-Login Session Discipline
    
    During the first session:
    
    - Do **not** log in anywhere
        
    - Do **not** use:
        
        - Personal accounts
            
        - Email
            
        - Usernames you used before
            
    
    Why:
    
    - Logging in connects activity to an identity
        
    - Even one login can break separation
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    First session = browsing only, no logging in.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 2: Avoiding Premature Account Creation
    
    Do not rush to create accounts.
    
    Avoid:
    
    - Registering on forums
        
    - Creating profiles
        
    - Setting usernames “just to try”
        
    
    Why this is risky:
    
    - Early decisions are often careless
        
    - Usernames and habits stick for a long time
        
    
    Better approach:
    
    - Observe first
        
    - Learn how sites behave
        
    - Create accounts later, if needed
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Don’t create identities before you understand the environment.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 3: Behavioral Consistency Awareness
    
    How you behave matters.
    
    Things that create patterns:
    
    - Clicking too fast
        
    - Opening many tabs quickly
        
    - Jumping between many sites
        
    
    Good habit:
    
    - Move slowly
        
    - Read pages fully
        
    - Act like a normal, calm user
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Calm behavior blends in better than rushed behavior.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 4: Keystroke and Timing Signals (Basic Awareness)
    
    Every user types and clicks differently.
    
    Important for beginners:
    
    - You do **not** need to change how you type
        
    - Just avoid:
        
        - Very fast, frantic typing
            
        - Repeated copy–paste actions
            
    
    The goal is not perfection—just **normal use**.
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Act normal; don’t overthink typing.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 5: Early-Session Mistake Patterns
    
    Common beginner mistakes:
    
    - Clicking everything out of curiosity
        
    - Downloading files “just to see”
        
    - Trusting the first site found
        
    - Staying online for too long
        
    
    Better approach:
    
    - Short sessions
        
    - Limited actions
        
    - Clear purpose
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Less activity = fewer mistakes.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 6: First-Session Mindset
    
    The first session should focus on:
    
    - Learning how things look
        
    - Understanding site behavior
        
    - Getting comfortable with navigation
        
    
    It should **not** focus on:
    
    - Transactions
        
    - Communication
        
    - Long-term actions
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    The first session is for observation, not action.
