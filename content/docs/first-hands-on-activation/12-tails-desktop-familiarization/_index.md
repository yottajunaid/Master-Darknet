- ## Step 1: Application Menu Layout
    
    - Look at the top-left or top bar of the screen.
        
    - You will see an **Applications menu**.
        
    - This menu contains:
        
        - Internet tools
            
        - Utilities
            
        - Settings
            
        - System tools
            
    
    Important things to know:
    
    - Applications are grouped by category
        
    - You do not need to open everything
        
    - Many tools are for specific purposes only
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    The menu shows what tools exist—use only what you need.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 2: System Status Indicators
    
    On the top bar, you will see small icons.
    
    These icons show:
    
    - Battery level
        
    - Sound volume
        
    - Date and time
        
    - System notifications
        
    
    Why this matters:
    
    - Low battery can cause sudden shutdown
        
    - System messages can warn you about problems
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    These icons tell you how the system is feeling.

    ## Step 3: Network and Tor Status Icons
    
    Also on the top bar:
    
    - A **network icon** shows Wi-Fi status
        
    - A **Tor icon** shows Tor connection status
        
    
    What to check:
    
    - Network icon shows connected
        
    - Tor icon shows connected or active
        
    
    If Tor icon shows a warning:
    
    - Do not browse yet
        
    - Fix the connection first
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Green/normal icons mean it’s safe to continue.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 4: Unsafe Application Identification
    
    Not all applications are safe for anonymity.
    
    Important rule:
    
    - Only use applications that are **designed to work with Tor**
    
    Avoid:
    
    - Unknown tools
        
    - Random system apps
        
    - Anything that accesses the internet outside Tor
        
    
    If you are unsure:
    
    - Do not open it
        
    - Ask or skip it
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    If you don’t know what an app does, don’t open it.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 5: Session-Only Tool Awareness
    
    Tails is **temporary by default**.
    
    This means:
    
    - Files disappear after shutdown
        
    - History is erased
        
    - Settings reset unless saved in persistent storage
        
    
    So:
    
    - Do not expect files to stay
        
    - Do not save things casually
        
    - Understand that this session will end completely
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    When you shut down, everything disappears.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 6: Calm Exploration Before Action
    
    Before browsing:
    
    - Spend a minute looking around
        
    - Learn where things are
        
    - Do not rush into websites or searches
        
    
    This helps:
    
    - Reduce mistakes
        
    - Avoid clicking wrong things
        
    - Build confidence
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Look first, act later.
