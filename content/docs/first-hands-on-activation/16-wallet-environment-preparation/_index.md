- ## Step 1: Wallet Application Discovery
    
    - Tails may include or allow access to **wallet-related tools**
        
    - These tools are used to:
        
        - Hold digital money
            
        - Show balances
            
        - Create receiving addresses
            
    
    Important for beginners:
    
    - You do not need to open a wallet immediately
        
    - First, just **know that wallet tools exist**
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    A wallet app is like a digital money holder.

    ## Step 2: Cold vs Hot Wallet Context
    
    There are two basic wallet ideas:
    
    - **Hot wallet**
        
        - Connected to the internet
            
        - Easy to use
            
        - Higher risk
            
    - **Cold wallet**
        
        - Not connected to the internet
            
        - Harder to use
            
        - Safer
            
    
    For learning:
    
    - Understand the difference
        
    - Do not rush to choose
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Online wallets are easier; offline wallets are safer.

    ## Step 3: Address Generation Awareness
    
    Wallets can create **addresses**.
    
    Important things to know:
    
    - An address is where money can be received
        
    - Addresses are not names
        
    - Many addresses can exist for one wallet
        
    
    Beginner mindset:
    
    - Generating addresses creates data
        
    - Data can become part of an identity
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Addresses are like account numbers, not names.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 4: Persistence vs Volatile Storage
    
    Where the wallet is stored matters.
    
    Two possibilities:
    
    - **Volatile (temporary)**
        
        - Disappears after shutdown
            
        - Safer for short use
            
    - **Persistent (saved)**
        
        - Comes back next time
            
        - Convenient but risky
            
    
    Important understanding:
    
    - Saving a wallet means long-term presence
        
    - Long-term presence increases exposure
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Saving a wallet makes it stay; not saving makes it vanish.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 5: Wallet Exposure Risks
    
    Wallets carry **real value**, so risks are higher.
    
    Possible risks:
    
    - USB loss
        
    - Weak passphrase
        
    - Accidental exposure
        
    - Forgetting what was saved
        
    
    Important habit:
    
    - Treat wallet data as sensitive
        
    - Do not experiment casually
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Wallet mistakes can cost real money.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 6: Beginner Wallet Mindset
    
    For first hands-on sessions:
    
    - Observation is enough
        
    - Understanding is more important than action
        
    - Wallet usage can come later
        
    
    Best practice:
    
    - Learn first
        
    - Act later
        
    - Keep things simple
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    You don’t need to use a wallet to understand it.
