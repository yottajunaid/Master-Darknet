- ## Step 1: Enabling Specific Persistence Options
    
    - Persistent Storage does **nothing by default**
        
    - You must **turn on** what you want to save
        
    
    Examples of options you may see:
    
    - Files
        
    - Browser settings
        
    - Keys
        
    - Other tools
        
    
    Important rule:
    
    - Do **not** turn everything on
        
    - Turn on **only what you truly need**
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    More saved data = more risk.

    ## Step 2: Wallet Persistence Awareness
    
    Some users want wallets to be saved.
    
    Important things to understand:
    
    - Wallet data is sensitive
        
    - If saved, it stays on the USB
        
    - If USB is lost, wallet data is exposed (even if encrypted)
        
    
    Best mindset:
    
    - Only save wallet data if necessary
        
    - Understand that persistence means long-term presence
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Saving wallet data is convenient, but risky.

    ## Step 3: Browser Data Persistence Risks
    
    Browser-related options may include:
    
    - Bookmarks
        
    - Settings
        
    - Cookies
        
    - Saved sessions
        
    
    Risks:
    
    - Saved browser data can create patterns
        
    - Patterns can reduce anonymity over time
        
    
    Good practice:
    
    - Avoid saving browsing history
        
    - Avoid saving unnecessary browser data
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Browsers remember more than you think.

    ## Step 4: SSH / GPG Persistence Context
    
    Some advanced tools use keys (like cryptographic keys).
    
    What to know:
    
    - Keys identify you across sessions
        
    - Saving keys creates continuity
        
    - Continuity can be useful or dangerous
        
    
    For beginners:
    
    - Only enable key persistence if you understand why
        
    - Do not enable “just in case”
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Saved keys = same identity every time.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 5: Persistence Hygiene (Clean Habits)
    
    Persistence hygiene means **keeping stored data clean and minimal**.
    
    Good habits:
    
    - Review enabled options regularly
        
    - Disable features you no longer need
        
    - Delete old files
        
    - Avoid storing random data
        
    
    Bad habits:
    
    - Saving everything
        
    - Forgetting what is enabled
        
    - Treating persistence like normal storage
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Persistent Storage should stay small and clean.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 6: Decide Each Session
    
    Every time Tails starts:
    
    - You can choose to unlock persistence or not
    
    Ask yourself:
    
    - Do I need saved data today?
        
    - Can I work without it?
        
    
    If not needed:
    
    - Do not unlock it
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    You don’t always need to use persistence.
