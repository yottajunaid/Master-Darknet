title: "7\. Wireless Router and Network Context Assessment"

- ## Step 1: Public vs Private Network Identification
    
    First, understand **what type of Wi-Fi** you are using.
    
    ### Public networks:
    
    - Coffee shops
        
    - Airports
        
    - Hotels
        
    - Libraries
        
    - Shared offices
        
    
    ### Private networks:
    
    - Home Wi-Fi
        
    - Personal hotspot
        
    - Lab-controlled router
        
    
    Important differences:
    
    - Public Wi-Fi is used by many people
        
    - Private Wi-Fi is used by fewer, known users
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Public Wi-Fi = shared with strangers  
    Private Wi-Fi = more controlled
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 2: Router Logging and Visibility Reality
    
    Every Wi-Fi network uses a **router**.
    
    What routers can usually see:
    
    - A device connected
        
    - When it connected
        
    - How much data is used
        
    
    What routers usually **cannot** see:
    
    - Exact website content when Tor is used
        
    - What you type inside Tor Browser
        
    
    Important mindset:
    
    - Do not assume the router sees nothing
        
    - Do not assume it sees everything
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    The router can see activity exists, not details.

    ## Step 3: Captive Portal Scenarios
    
    Some networks show a **login page** before internet works.
    
    Examples:
    
    - “Accept Terms”
        
    - “Login to Wi-Fi”
        
    - “Enter Room Number”
        
    
    These are called **captive portals**.
    
    What to know:
    
    - Internet will not work until the page is completed
        
    - Tor may not connect properly before this step
        
    - This is common on public Wi-Fi
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Some Wi-Fi needs permission before internet starts.

    ## Step 4: Network Fingerprinting Risks (Basic Awareness)
    
    Networks can sometimes notice:
    
    - Device type
        
    - Connection behavior
        
    - Timing patterns
        
    
    This does **not** mean:
    
    - Panic
        
    - Complex action
        
    
    It means:
    
    - Avoid unnecessary activity
        
    - Do not connect and disconnect repeatedly
        
    - Be calm and normal in usage
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Strange behavior attracts attention; normal behavior blends in.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 5: Adversarial Network Indicators (Basic Signs)
    
    Some networks may feel **unusual or unsafe**.
    
    Possible warning signs:
    
    - Wi-Fi name looks fake or copied
        
    - Network disconnects often
        
    - Internet behaves strangely
        
    - Unexpected login pages appear
        
    
    What to do:
    
    - Do not rush
        
    - If unsure, do not continue
        
    - Choose another network if possible
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    If a network feels wrong, trust that feeling.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 6: Decide Before Connecting
    
    Before clicking “Connect”, ask yourself:
    
    - Is this public or private Wi-Fi?
        
    - Does it require a login page?
        
    - Does it behave normally?
        
    
    Only after answering:
    
    - Proceed to connect
        
    - Move to the Tor connection stage
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Think first, then connect.
