- ## Step 1: Choose a Proper Workspace
    
    - Sit in a **quiet place** where fewer people come and go.
        
    - Do not work in:
        
        - Cafes
            
        - Public libraries
            
        - Crowded rooms
            
    - Choose a place where:
        
        - You can focus
            
        - Nobody is watching your screen
            
        - You will not be disturbed
            
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Pick a calm and private place to work.

    ## Step 2: Remove Unnecessary Smart Devices
    
    Look around the room and find devices like:
    
    - Mobile phones
        
    - Smart watches
        
    - Smart speakers (Alexa, Google Home, etc.)
        
    - Smart TVs
        
    - Tablets
        
    
    Now:
    
    - Turn them **off**
        
    - If possible, **take them out of the room**
        
    
    If you cannot remove them:
    
    - Unplug them from power
        
    - Keep them far away
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Remove devices that can listen, record, or connect to the internet.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 3: Be Aware of Cameras and Microphones
    
    Check your laptop and surroundings for:
    
    - Laptop webcam
        
    - External webcam
        
    - Microphone holes
        
    - Cameras on monitors
        
    
    Remember:
    
    - Cameras and microphones can work even when you think they are off
        
    - Software settings are not always reliable
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Assume cameras and microphones are always ON unless blocked physically.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 4: Cover Cameras Physically
    
    - Use tape, a sticker, or a webcam cover
        
    - Make sure the camera lens is fully covered
        
    - Do **not** trust:
        
        - Software camera off buttons
            
        - Camera LED lights
            
    
    For microphones:
    
    - Keep the laptop a little farther from your face
        
    - Do not speak unnecessary things near the device
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    If the camera cannot see, it cannot record.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 5: Check Connected Devices (Peripherals)
    
    Look at what is connected to your computer:
    
    - USB drives
        
    - External hard disks
        
    - USB hubs
        
    - Mouse and keyboard
        
    - Wi-Fi adapters
        
    
    Now:
    
    - Remove anything you are **not using**
        
    - Remove anything you **don’t recognize**
        
    - Keep only what is needed for the task
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Only connect devices that you trust and need.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 6: Final Check Before Turning On the Computer
    
    Before booting:
    
    - Look around the room again
        
    - Confirm:
        
        - Phones are removed
            
        - Cameras are covered
            
        - Only required devices are connected
            
        - No one is watching
            
    
    Only after this:
    
    - Turn on the computer
        
    - Start the practical work
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Fix the room first, then touch the computer.
