- ## Step 1: Adapter Interface Selection
    
    - Look at the Wi-Fi icon on the screen.
        
    - Click it to open the network list.
        
    - If more than one Wi-Fi device exists:
        
        - The system may show multiple options
    - Choose the one that belongs to the **USB Wi-Fi adapter**.
        
    
    You usually know it is correct when:
    
    - Wi-Fi networks appear
        
    - The list refreshes normally
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Make sure you are using the USB Wi-Fi, not something else.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 2: Network Discovery Behavior
    
    After selecting Wi-Fi:
    
    - The system scans for nearby networks
        
    - Network names (Wi-Fi names) appear
        
    
    Normal behavior:
    
    - List loads in a few seconds
        
    - Networks appear and disappear slightly
        
    - Signal bars change
        
    
    Not normal:
    
    - No networks appear at all
        
    - List freezes completely
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Seeing Wi-Fi names means scanning is working.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 3: Authentication Dialog Awareness
    
    When you click a Wi-Fi network:
    
    - A box may appear asking for:
        
        - Wi-Fi password
            
        - Agreement or confirmation
            
    
    What to do:
    
    - Type carefully
        
    - Double-check spelling
        
    - Do not rush
        
    
    If there is no password:
    
    - The network is open
        
    - Be extra cautious
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    This is the step where you prove you are allowed to join the network.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 4: Signal Strength vs Risk Tradeoff
    
    Wi-Fi networks show signal strength (bars).
    
    Important things to know:
    
    - Strong signal = better connection
        
    - Weak signal = unstable connection
        
    
    However:
    
    - The strongest signal is not always the safest network
        
    - Do not choose a network only because it has full bars
        
    
    Balance:
    
    - Prefer stable networks
        
    - Avoid suspicious or unknown networks
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Good signal is useful, but trust matters more.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 5: Connection Failure Patterns
    
    Sometimes connection fails. Common reasons:
    
    - Wrong password
        
    - Weak signal
        
    - Network overloaded
        
    - Temporary network issues
        
    
    What you may see:
    
    - “Connection failed”
        
    - Keeps asking for password
        
    - Connects, then disconnects
        
    
    What to do:
    
    - Stop
        
    - Recheck password
        
    - Try once more
        
    - If it keeps failing, choose another network
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Repeated failure means stop and reassess.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 6: Successful Connection Confirmation
    
    You know you are connected when:
    
    - Wi-Fi icon shows connected status
        
    - No error messages appear
        
    - Internet becomes available
        
    
    After this:
    
    - Do not open the browser immediately
        
    - Let the connection stabilize
        
    - Prepare for Tor connection next
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Wait for a stable connection before moving forward.
