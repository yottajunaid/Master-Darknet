- ## Step 1: Selection of Trusted USB Media
    
    - Use a **new USB drive** if possible.
        
    - If not new, use a USB drive that:
        
        - You personally own
            
        - You have used before
            
        - You trust
            
    - Do **not** use USB drives that:
        
        - Came from unknown people
            
        - Were found somewhere
            
        - Were used on many random computers
            
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    If you don’t trust the USB, don’t use it.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 2: Dedicated USB Usage Policy
    
    - Decide that this USB drive is **only for Tails OS**
        
    - Do not use this USB for:
        
        - Movies
            
        - Music
            
        - Office files
            
        - Personal storage
            
    - Do not plug this USB into:
        
        - Friends’ computers
            
        - Office systems
            
        - Public computers
            
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    One USB = one purpose only.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 3: Media Labeling and Lifecycle Control
    
    - Physically label the USB drive using:
        
        - A sticker
            
        - A marker
            
    - Example labels:
        
        - “Tails Only”
            
        - “Secure OS USB”
            
    - Keep track of:
        
        - When you created it
            
        - Where you used it
            
    - If the USB is lost or damaged:
        
        - Stop using it permanently
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Know which USB it is and where it has been used.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 4: Cross-Contamination Avoidance
    
    Cross-contamination means **mixing safe and unsafe usage**.
    
    To avoid it:
    
    - Do not use the Tails USB on:
        
        - Windows machines you don’t control
            
        - Internet cafés
            
    - Do not copy files from:
        
        - Random USB drives
            
        - Unknown systems
            
    - Do not plug unknown USB drives into your Tails system
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Do not mix trusted and untrusted devices.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 5: Storage Chain-of-Custody Awareness
    
    This means **knowing who handled the USB**.
    
    - Always know:
        
        - Who used the USB
            
        - Where it was stored
            
    - Store the USB:
        
        - In a safe place
            
        - Not lying around openly
            
    - Do not lend the USB to others
        
    - Treat it like:
        
        - A key
            
        - An ID card
            
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    If you lose control of the USB, you lose trust in it.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Step 6: Final USB Readiness Check
    
    Before burning Tails OS:
    
    - Confirm:
        
        - USB is trusted
            
        - USB is clean
            
        - USB is only for this task
            
        - USB has not been shared
            
    
    Only after this:
    
    - Start the Tails OS burning process
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Prepare the USB properly before using it.
