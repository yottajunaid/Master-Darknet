title: "3.4 Post-Quantum Threats to Darknets"
weight: 4

Modern hidden services rely heavily on cryptography that is secure against **classical computers**.  
However, advances in **quantum computing** introduce a new category of threats that directly affect the **long-term security assumptions** of darknets and anonymous services.

This section explains **what post-quantum threats are**, **which parts of darknet cryptography are affected**, and **why this matters for hidden services**, using accepted cryptographic research and standards.

* * *

## **A. What Is a Post-Quantum Threat?**

A **post-quantum threat** refers to the risk that future **quantum computers** could efficiently break cryptographic algorithms that are currently considered secure.

This is not science fiction.  
It is a **recognized cryptographic transition problem** acknowledged by:

- NIST (USA)
    
- ETSI (EU)
    
- NSA (Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite)
    
- Academic cryptography communities
    

The concern is not *if* quantum computers arrive, but *when* they reach cryptographically relevant scale.

* * *

## **B. Why Darknets Are Especially Sensitive to Quantum Threats**

Darknets and hidden services face unique risks:

1.  **Long-term confidentiality requirements**  
    Some communications must remain private for decades.
    
2.  **Passive global adversaries**  
    Adversaries may record traffic today and decrypt it years later.
    
3.  **Self-authenticating identities**  
    Onion addresses are derived directly from cryptographic keys.
    
4.  **No central revocation authority**  
    If cryptography breaks, recovery is harder than on the clearnet.
    

This makes post-quantum risk **more severe for darknets** than for ordinary web systems.

* * *

## **C. Quantum Algorithms That Matter for Darknets**

Two quantum algorithms are relevant:

* * *

### **1\. Shor’s Algorithm (Critical Threat)**

Shor’s algorithm can efficiently break:

- RSA
    
- Diffie–Hellman
    
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
    

This directly impacts:

- Tor relay identity keys
    
- Onion service identity keys (Ed25519)
    
- Key exchange mechanisms
    
- Self-authenticating `.onion` addresses
    

If a sufficiently powerful quantum computer exists, **current onion service identities could be forged**.

* * *

### **2\. Grover’s Algorithm (Moderate Threat)**

Grover’s algorithm weakens:

- symmetric encryption (AES)
    
- hash functions (SHA-2, SHA-3)
    

Effect:

- halves effective key strength

Mitigation:

- larger key sizes (already mostly in place)

This threat is **manageable**, unlike Shor’s algorithm.

* * *

## **D. “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” (HN-DL) Risk**

One of the most discussed post-quantum risks is **HN-DL**:

1.  Adversary records encrypted darknet traffic today
    
2.  Stores it indefinitely
    
3.  Decrypts it in the future using quantum capabilities
    

This is dangerous even if:

- systems are secure today
    
- users behave correctly
    

Forward secrecy helps, but **identity-layer cryptography remains vulnerable**.

* * *

## **E. Impact on Hidden Services Specifically**

Post-quantum threats affect hidden services in several ways:

### **1\. Onion Service Identity Compromise**

- Onion addresses embed public keys
    
- Quantum attacks could allow impersonation
    
- Trust in self-authenticating names would fail
    

### **2\. HSDir Descriptor Integrity**

- Descriptor signatures rely on ECC
    
- Quantum adversaries could forge or manipulate descriptors
    

### **3\. Long-Term Service Tracking**

- Recorded metadata could be re-analyzed
    
- Historical service behavior may become linkable
    

* * *

## **F. What Post-Quantum Threats Do *Not* Immediately Break**

Important clarification:

- Onion routing itself does **not instantly fail**
    
- Symmetric encryption remains strong with larger keys
    
- Quantum computers do **not magically reveal IP addresses**
    

The threat is **cryptographic trust erosion**, not immediate deanonymization.

* * *

## **G. Why This Is a Design Concern, Not a Panic**

No known quantum computer today can:

- break ECC at required scale
    
- threaten Tor in real time
    

However:

- cryptographic systems take **years to migrate**
    
- darknets cannot rely on emergency upgrades
    

Therefore, post-quantum planning is a **long-term architectural concern**, not an operational crisis.

* * *

## **H. Relationship to v3 Onion Services**

v3 onion services improve:

- forward secrecy
    
- identity rotation
    
- descriptor privacy
    

But they still rely on **ECC**, which is quantum-vulnerable.

So:

- v3 is **quantum-aware**
    
- not **quantum-resistant**
    

This distinction is crucial.

* * *

## **I. Why Darknets Must Plan Early**

History shows:

- RSA-1024 was once “safe”
    
- SHA-1 was once “safe”
    
- v2 onion services were once “good enough”
    

Post-quantum threats reinforce a core lesson:

> Cryptography ages, anonymity systems must anticipate that aging.
