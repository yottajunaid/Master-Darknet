Latency — the delay between sending and receiving data — is one of the most defining characteristics of any anonymity network.  
Every darknet (Tor, I2P, Freenet, GNUnet, Yggdrasil, Nym) is designed for a different privacy model, and therefore, latency is not a “bug” but a **design decision**.

This chapter examines how architectural choices affect latency, bandwidth, routing delay, and real-world responsiveness.

* * *

# **A. Why Latency Matters in Darknets**

Latency affects:

- user experience
    
- bandwidth usage
    
- reliability of connections
    
- feasibility of real-time applications
    
- anonymity strength
    

In anonymity systems, **lower latency usually means weaker anonymity**, while **higher latency often correlates with stronger anonymity** (especially against global adversaries).

This is known as the **latency–anonymity tradeoff**.

# **B. Low-Latency vs High-Latency Anonymous Networks**

| Type | Purpose | Examples | Average Latency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Low-Latency Networks** | Real-time usage | Tor, Lokinet, Yggdrasil | 50 ms – 600 ms |
| **Medium-Latency Networks** | Peer-to-peer, internal darknet | I2P, GNUnet | 200 ms – several seconds |
| **High-Latency Networks** | Strong metadata resistance | Nym, Loopix, mixnets | Several seconds to minutes |

No darknet is optimized for all three: **speed, security, and anonymity**.

* * *

# **C. Latency Factors Across Darknets**

Latency differences are caused by:

1.  **Routing architecture** (onion, garlic, DHT, mixnet)
    
2.  **Number of hops** in each request
    
3.  **Cryptographic operations** required per message
    
4.  **Node selection and trust model**
    
5.  **Network congestion**
    
6.  **Geographical distribution of nodes**
    
7.  **Design priorities** (speed vs anonymity vs decentralization)
    

Let’s analyze each network individually.

* * *

# **D. Tor Latency Characteristics (Low-Latency Onion Routing)**

Tor uses **three-hop circuits** with layered encryption.

### **Latency Profile**

- Typical: **100–600 ms**
    
- Higher under congestion
    
- Lower than I2P due to centralized directory authorities enabling optimized routing
    

### **Reasons for Moderate Latency**

1.  **Relays are volunteer-based** and unpredictable in performance.
    
2.  **Multiple encryption layers** add processing time.
    
3.  **Circuits rotate every ~10 minutes**, adding overhead.
    
4.  **Path length fixed at 3 hops**, balancing anonymity and latency.
    

### **Real-World Findings**

Empirical studies show Tor is suitable for:

- browsing
    
- messaging
    
- moderate-speed downloads
    

Not ideal for:

- VoIP
    
- video streaming
    
- high-throughput applications

# **E. I2P Latency Characteristics (Unidirectional Tunnels + Garlic Routing)**

I2P routes data through **separate inbound and outbound tunnels**, increasing routing complexity.

### **Latency Profile**

- Typically: **150 ms – several seconds**
    
- Higher than Tor in many experiments
    
- Highly dependent on tunnel length and peer performance
    

### **Reasons for Higher Latency**

1.  Two independent tunnels increase overhead.
    
2.  DHT-based router selection introduces randomness.
    
3.  Garlic routing bundles multiple messages, adding processing time.
    
4.  Internal peer-to-peer design prioritizes anonymity over speed.
    

I2P is optimized for:

- internal darknet websites
    
- P2P file sharing
    
- anonymous chat

# **F. Freenet Latency Characteristics (Distributed Data Store)**

Freenet is not designed for interactive browsing.  
It is effectively a **distributed cache retrieval system** with probabilistic routing.

### **Latency Profile**

- Can range from **several seconds to several minutes**
    
- Depends heavily on:
    
    - network size
        
    - content popularity
        
    - data replication proximity
        

### **Reasons for High Latency**

1.  No direct path to content — routing is probabilistic.
    
2.  Data is split into encrypted chunks across the network.
    
3.  Requests may traverse many hops before completion.
    

Ideal for:

- censorship-resistant publishing
    
- long-term archival storage
    

Not designed for real-time use.

# **G. GNUnet Latency Characteristics (Peer Group Cryptography & Transport Plugins)**

GNUnet’s routing protocols vary depending on which subsystem is used.

### **Latency Profile**

- **Medium to high latency**
    
- Varies greatly with transport plugin (TCP, UDP, Bluetooth)
    

### **Reasons**

1.  Heavy cryptographic authentication between peer groups.
    
2.  Flexible routing layers introduce additional overhead.
    
3.  Emphasis on distributed trust over speed.
    

GNUnet is optimized for:

- censorship-resistant naming (GNS)
    
- distributed identity
    
- private group communications

# **H. Yggdrasil Latency Characteristics (Encrypted IPv6 Mesh)**

Yggdrasil provides encrypted routing but **not anonymity**.  
It aims for fast, stable global mesh networking.

### **Latency Profile**

- Low latency: **20–100 ms** depending on proximity
    
- Comparable to VPN tunneling
    
- Faster than Tor and I2P in most cases
    

### **Reasons**

1.  Efficient DHT-based routing.
    
2.  Minimal cryptographic overhead compared to onion routing.
    
3.  Emphasis on secure connectivity, not anonymity.
    

Ideal for:

- decentralized applications
    
- peer mesh networking

# **I. Nym Latency Characteristics (High-Latency Mixnet)**

Nym is designed for **maximum metadata resistance**, not speed.

### **Latency Profile**

- **Several seconds to minutes**
    
- Controlled delays intentionally disrupt timing correlations
    

### **Why High Latency?**

Mixnets deliberately add:

- batching
    
- shuffling
    
- timing obfuscation
    
- multi-hop message mixing
    

Ideal for:

- whistleblowing
    
- private messaging
    
- metadata-resistant communication
    

Not suitable for:

- web browsing
    
- real-time activities

# **J. Latency Comparison Table (Summary)**

| Network | Latency Level | Routing Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Yggdrasil** | Low | DHT Mesh | Fastest, not anonymity-focused |
| **Lokinet** | Low to Medium | LLARP | Designed for real-time anonymous apps |
| **Tor** | Medium | Onion Routing | Balanced anonymity vs speed |
| **I2P** | Medium to High | Garlic Routing | Higher latency due to dual tunnels |
| **GNUnet** | Medium to High | Peer-group routing | Flexible but heavy cryptography |
| **Freenet** | High | Key-based data retrieval | Storage system, not real-time |
| **Nym** | Very High | Mixnet | Strongest metadata protection |

# **K. Why Latency Differences Matter**

Each network optimizes for a different goal:

- **Speed:** Yggdrasil, Lokinet
    
- **Balanced anonymity:** Tor
    
- **Decentralized anonymity:** I2P
    
- **Storage-based censorship resistance:** Freenet
    
- **Trust-based anonymity:** GNUnet
    
- **Metadata resistance:** Nym
    

Latency is therefore a direct reflection of a network’s **threat model** and **design philosophy**, not a defect.
