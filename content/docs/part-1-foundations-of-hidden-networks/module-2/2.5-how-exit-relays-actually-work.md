In the Tor network, the **Exit Relay** (sometimes simply called an “exit node”) is the final hop in a Tor circuit when a user accesses the normal internet (the “clearnet”).  
Exit relays play a unique role because they are the only Tor nodes that interact directly with external websites.

This chapter explains, in depth, **how exit relays function**, what they can and cannot see, how traffic flows through them, and why they are essential despite being a common source of misunderstanding.

* * *

# **A. What Is an Exit Relay?**

An **exit relay** is the Tor relay responsible for:

- removing the final layer of onion encryption
    
- forwarding the decrypted request to the clearnet destination
    
- receiving the response from the clearnet and re-encrypting it for the user
    

It is the only point in a Tor circuit where Tor traffic becomes **ordinary internet traffic**.

Exit relays **do not** know who the user is; they only see:

- the destination site
    
- plaintext data *if the site does not use HTTPS*
    

Even then, they only see the *content*, not the user’s identity.

* * *

# **B. Position of the Exit Relay in the Tor Circuit**

A Tor circuit consists of:

1.  **Entry Guard (first hop)**
    
2.  **Middle Relay (second hop)**
    
3.  **Exit Relay (third hop)**
    

Data flow (simplified):

`User → Entry Guard → Middle Relay → Exit Relay → Destination Website`

The exit relay only sees **decrypted** outgoing traffic *and* the destination server.  
It **cannot** see:

- user IP
    
- user identity
    
- user location
    
- user’s entry guard
    

This separation of knowledge is fundamental to Tor’s anonymity design.

* * *

# **C. What the Exit Relay Can See**

Exit relays have visibility over **exactly two things**:

### **1\. The Final Unencrypted Layer of Data**

If a user visits:

- **HTTP** websites → exit relay can read content
    
- **HTTPS** websites → content is fully encrypted; exit relay sees nothing meaningful
    

Since most modern websites use HTTPS, exit relays cannot read the majority of traffic.

### **2\. The Destination IP and Port**

Exit relays must know where to forward the traffic.  
They see:

`Destination server IP Requested port (e.g., port 80 for HTTP)`

Nothing else.

* * *

# **D. What Exit Relays Cannot See**

Despite popular myths, exit relays **cannot**:

1.  **See the user's IP address**  
    That information is hidden by the guard relay.
    
2.  **Know the user's identity**  
    All Tor traffic is layered and encrypted.
    
3.  **Decrypt HTTPS traffic**  
    HTTPS encryption terminates at the destination server, not the exit node.
    
4.  **See internal Tor circuits**  
    Each hop removes only one encryption layer.
    
5.  **Determine where the user is located**  
    IP geolocation is impossible from the exit’s perspective.
    
6.  **Trace the user back through the Tor network**  
    No single relay has enough information.

# **E. Why Exit Relays Exist**

Many darknet systems (I2P, Freenet) do not allow clearnet access.  
Tor intentionally supports clearnet access to create a **practical anonymity system** for:

- researchers
    
- journalists
    
- everyday users seeking privacy
    
- citizens in censored environments
    

Exit relays act as **translation bridges** between:

- anonymous Tor circuits
    
- the normal, public internet
    

Without exit relays, Tor would be an internal-only network like I2P.

# **F. Exit Relay Policies & Restrictions**

Exit relays operate under specific rules:

### **1\. Exit Policies**

Relay operators specify which ports/services they allow.  
For example:

- allow ports 80 and 443
    
- deny SMTP ports to prevent spam
    
- deny risky ports to reduce abuse
    

These policies shape how traffic routes through the network.

### **2\. Abuse Management**

Exit operators often receive:

- DMCA notices
    
- abuse complaints
    
- legal inquiries
    

However, Tor Project provides guides explaining that operators cannot identify users.

Exit operators are not responsible for user actions, as they do not know who the user is.

* * *

# **G. Exit Relays & HTTPS: A Critical Distinction**

### **If the site uses HTTPS**:

- exit relay sees only encrypted TLS packets
    
- cannot read or manipulate content
    
- cannot insert malware
    
- cannot observe personal data
    

### **If the site uses HTTP**:

- exit relay *can* see content
    
- but still cannot see the user’s identity
    

Modern browsers enforce HTTPS with:

- HSTS
    
- automatic HTTPS upgrades
    
- certificate pinning
    

This greatly reduces exit relay visibility.

# **H. Exit Traffic Fingerprinting & Academic Findings**

Exit relay behavior has been studied extensively in academia.

Key findings include:

### **1\. Exit Relays Are Often Underpowered**

Volunteer-run nodes have limited bandwidth.

### **2\. Exit Relays Are Bottlenecks**

Clearnet-bound traffic flows through relatively few relays compared to entry or middle nodes.

### **3\. Malicious Exit Relays Are Rare but Possible**

Some research uncovered misconfigured or malicious exits attempting:

- TLS downgrades
    
- traffic injection
    
- DNS tampering
    

Tor mitigates these using:

- Relay operator vetting
    
- Exit scanning (Tor "exitmap" research)
    
- Community reporting
    
- Consensus weighting
    

No single malicious exit can deanonymize a user due to Tor’s architecture.

* * *

# **I. Why Exit Relays Cannot De-Anonymize Tor Users Alone**

To deanonymize a user, an adversary must control:

1.  The **entry guard** (to see user IP)
    
2.  The **exit relay** (to see destination)
    

Controlling both simultaneously is difficult due to:

- guard rotation policies
    
- consensus mechanisms
    
- diverse volunteer relay operators
    
- large network size
    

A malicious exit **alone** is insufficient for deanonymization.

* * *

# **J. Exit Relays for .onion Services**

When a user accesses a **.onion service**:

- **exit relays are not used at all**
    
- the entire circuit remains internal to Tor
    
- both sides use rendezvous points
    
- traffic never touches the clearnet
    

This increases anonymity and security.
