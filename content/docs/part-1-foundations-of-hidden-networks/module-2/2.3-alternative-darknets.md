While Tor is the most well-known anonymity network, it represents only *one model* of hidden network architecture.  
Other darknets — I2P, Freenet, GNUnet, Yggdrasil, and Nym — use **fundamentally different routing designs**, anonymity concepts, and security assumptions.

This chapter explains the underlying mechanisms that make each network unique.

* * *

# **A. I2P (Invisible Internet Project) — Tunnels & Garlic Routing**

I2P is a self-contained darknet focusing on **internal anonymous services** rather than clearnet access.  
Its architecture relies on a **tunnel-based routing system** and a unique encryption approach called **garlic routing**.

* * *

## **1\. I2P Unidirectional Tunnels**

Unlike Tor, where traffic flows bidirectionally over a single circuit, I2P builds **two independent tunnels**:

- **Inbound Tunnel:** carries data *toward* the user
    
- **Outbound Tunnel:** carries data *away* from the user
    

### **Benefits**

- Breaks correlation between incoming and outgoing traffic
    
- Limits the impact of a compromised router
    
- Provides flexibility for performance tuning
    

Each tunnel is a series of routers that forward encrypted packets.

* * *

## **2\. Garlic Routing (I2P’s Encryption Model)**

Garlic routing extends onion routing by bundling multiple messages (“cloves”) into a single encrypted “garlic bulb.”

### **Advantages**

1.  **Anti-traffic-analysis**: harder to isolate individual messages.
    
2.  **Message aggregation**: routing instructions and payloads can be packaged together.
    
3.  **Decoy traffic**: supports padding and nested messaging.
    

Garlic routing is considered more flexible than onion routing for peer-to-peer anonymity.

* * *

## **3\. I2P Network Database (netDB)**

I2P uses a **distributed hash table (DHT)** to store:

- router information
    
- tunnel build records
    
- encrypted destination entries
    

This ensures:

- decentralization
    
- resilience
    
- no directory authorities (unlike Tor)
    

* * *

# **B. Freenet — Distributed Data Store & “Insert/Fetch” Mechanism**

Freenet is not a routing network like Tor or I2P.  
It is a **distributed, censorship-resistant storage system** built around a **key-based data retrieval model**.

* * *

## **1\. Key-Based Data Access**

Freenet uses three key types:

- **CHK (Content Hash Key):** ensures immutability
    
- **SSK (Signed Subspace Key):** allows updatable content
    
- **USK (Updatable Subspace Key):** supports pseudonymous updates
    

Data is retrieved by keys, not by location.

* * *

## **2\. Data Insert / Data Fetch Model**

### **Insert**

- User uploads data using a key.
    
- Chunks split and distributed across nodes.
    
- Replication occurs automatically.
    

### **Fetch**

- User requests a key.
    
- Network routes request through probabilistic local decisions.
    

This ensures censorship-resistance and plausible deniability.

* * *

## **3\. Location-Independent Storage**

Users do not know:

- where the data is stored
    
- who stores it
    
- how many copies exist
    

Nodes store encrypted chunks, making Freenet:

- anonymous
    
- fault-tolerant
    
- self-healing
    

* * *

# **C. GNUnet — Peer Group Cryptography & Privacy-Preserving Naming**

GNUnet is a framework for privacy-preserving, decentralized networking.  
It emphasizes **secure group communication**, **peer authentication**, and **anonymous services**.

* * *

## **1\. Peer Group Cryptography**

GNUnet forms “peer groups” where nodes authenticate using:

- public key infrastructure
    
- secure channel establishment
    
- routing within trusted peer subsets
    

This balances anonymity with authenticity.

* * *

## **2\. GNU Name System (GNS)**

Unlike DNS, GNS provides:

- decentralized name resolution
    
- censorship resistance
    
- privacy-preserving queries
    

Names are derived from:

- zones
    
- public keys
    
- delegation chains
    

This system avoids centralized control by ICANN or DNS root authorities.

* * *

## **3\. Transport Plugins**

GNUnet can run over:

- TCP
    
- UDP
    
- HTTP tunnels
    
- Bluetooth
    
- WLAN
    

This flexibility allows it to survive censorship conditions where Tor or I2P may fail.

* * *

# **D. Yggdrasil — DHT-Based Global IPv6 Mesh**

Yggdrasil is not a classical anonymity network — it is a **cryptographically secure global mesh networking overlay** that automatically assigns IPv6 addresses.

* * *

## **1\. Public-Key-Based Addressing**

Each node’s IPv6 address is derived from:

- its cryptographic key
    
- routing tree position
    

This ensures:

- end-to-end encryption
    
- secure cryptographic identity
    

* * *

## **2\. Distributed Hash Table Routing**

Nodes connect through a spanning-tree-based DHT.

### **Properties**

- efficient global pathfinding
    
- dynamic rebalancing
    
- robust connectivity
    

* * *

## **3\. Purpose**

Yggdrasil focuses on:

- encrypted connectivity
    
- decentralized internet infrastructure
    
- mesh-based peer routing
    

It offers privacy, but not the anonymity guarantees of Tor or Nym.

* * *

# **E. Nym Mixnet — Layered Privacy & Metadata Resistance**

Nym modernizes **Chaumian mix networks** for the contemporary internet age.

* * *

## **1\. Mix Nodes Perform Batch-and-Shuffle**

Each node:

- collects packets
    
- adds timing delays
    
- shuffles order
    
- forwards output
    

This destroys metadata such as:

- timing
    
- packet size
    
- order
    

Mixnets are designed to resist **global passive adversaries**, something onion routing struggles with.

* * *

## **2\. Sphinx Packet Format**

Sphinx provides:

- compact onion-style wrapping
    
- replay protection
    
- unlinkable routing
    
- reduced overhead
    

Originally a theoretical design, now used in production (Nym, Loopix).

* * *

## **3\. Layered Architecture**

Nym architecture includes:

- **Gateway Layer** — mixes ingress traffic
    
- **Mixnet Layer** — multi-hop mixing for anonymity
    
- **Credential Layer** — privacy-preserving authentication (ZK proofs)
    
- **Blockchain Layer** — decentralized incentive system
    

It offers some of the strongest metadata protection available today.
