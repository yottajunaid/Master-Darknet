weight: 7
---


Hidden networks — commonly called **darknets** — differ significantly in architecture, routing logic, threat models, and intended use cases.  
While most people only know Tor, the darknet ecosystem is an **entire family of anonymity-preserving overlay networks**, each engineered to solve a different type of privacy problem.

This chapter examines six major systems:

- **F2F Networks (Friend-to-Friend)**
    
- **I2P (Invisible Internet Project)**
    
- **Tor (The Onion Router)**
    
- **Yggdrasil**
    
- **Nym Mixnet**
    
- **Lokinet**
    

This comparative anatomy highlights their design philosophies, routing mechanisms, security assumptions, and sociotechnical roles.

# **A. F2F Networks (Friend-to-Friend)**

F2F networks are a category of peer-to-peer networks where **only trusted peers connect directly**.  
Examples include: Retroshare, GNUnet in F2F mode, and earlier P2P prototypes.

### **Key Architectural Features**

1.  **Private Peer Connections**  
    Users connect only to known contacts (friends).  
    This reduces exposure but limits scalability.
    
2.  **Decentralization**  
    No central servers.  
    Routing is done through trusted relationships.
    
3.  **High Resistance to Infiltration**  
    Hard for adversaries to enter without social engineering.
    
4.  **Low Anonymity Set**  
    The network size is limited to the number of trusted peers.
    

### **Use Case**

Ideal for:

- activist groups
    
- private communities
    
- censorship-resistant messaging
    

Not suited for large-scale anonymous publishing.

# **B. I2P — Invisible Internet Project**

I2P is a fully internal darknet designed so that **all traffic stays inside the network**.  
Its architecture uses **garlic routing**, an evolved form of onion routing where multiple messages are bundled together to make traffic analysis harder.

### **Key Architectural Features**

1.  **Unidirectional Tunnels**  
    Separate tunnels for inbound and outbound traffic.  
    This reduces certain correlation attacks.
    
2.  **Garlic Routing**  
    Multiple messages packed into a “garlic bulb.”  
    Harder to isolate individual packets.
    
3.  **Decentralized Routing**  
    No centralized directory authorities (unlike Tor).  
    Routing uses a distributed netDB (network database).
    
4.  **Internal Services (Eepsites)**  
    I2P hosts its own websites ending in `.i2p`.
    

### **Use Case**

- anonymous peer-to-peer applications
    
- chat, file-sharing
    
- decentralized communities
    
- internal anonymous services rather than clearnet access
    

* * *

# **C. Tor — The Onion Router**

Tor is the most widely known anonymity network, using **onion routing** with multi-layer encryption through volunteer nodes.

### **Key Architectural Features**

1.  **Onion Routing**  
    Data is wrapped in multiple encryption layers.  
    Each relay peels one layer and sends the packet forward.
    
2.  **Directory Authorities**  
    Centralized but highly audited servers that maintain the relay list.  
    Improve network reliability and consistency.
    
3.  **Hidden Services (.onion)**  
    Tor allows both client and server anonymity.
    
4.  **Large Anonymity Set**  
    Thousands of relays and millions of users.
    

### **Use Case**

- anonymity for browsing
    
- hosting hidden services
    
- journalism and secure drops
    
- anti-censorship
    

Tor sacrifices some performance for usability and scale.

# **D. Yggdrasil — Encrypted Global Mesh Network**

Yggdrasil is a newer experimental network that creates an **end-to-end encrypted IPv6-only global mesh** using a **Distributed Hash Table (DHT)** for routing.

### **Key Architectural Features**

1.  **End-to-End Encryption by Default**  
    Every node has a cryptographic public key as its address.
    
2.  **Global IPv6 Network**  
    Each node receives an IPv6 address derived from its public key.
    
3.  **DHT-Based Routing**  
    Ensures efficient path finding and global connectivity.
    
4.  **No Onion Routing**  
    Yggdrasil is focused on secure routing, not strong anonymity.
    

### **Use Case**

- decentralized infrastructure
    
- experimental networking
    
- global encrypted IPv6 overlay
    

Good for privacy, but *not designed as a strong anonymity network*.

# **E. Nym Mixnet — Next-Generation Metadata-Resistant Network**

Nym revives and modernizes **Chaumian mix networks**, designed to eliminate metadata leakage — something onion routing struggles with under global adversaries.

### **Key Architectural Features**

1.  **Mix Nodes**  
    Nodes batch, delay, and shuffle packets to break correlation.
    
2.  **Full Metadata Protection**  
    Prevents timing analysis, volume analysis, and global attacker correlation.
    
3.  **Sphinx Packet Format**  
    A modern, efficient, compact format for mix networks.
    
4.  **Incentivized Participation**  
    Nodes can be rewarded through blockchain mechanisms.
    

### **Use Case**

- high-security communications
    
- whistleblowing
    
- resistant to nation-state surveillance
    
- privacy for messaging and credentials
    

Nym is considered **stronger than Tor** in metadata protection, but slower because of batching delays.

# **F. Lokinet (Oxen Network)**

Lokinet is a privacy network based on the **LLARP (Low Latency Anonymous Routing Protocol)**, aiming for faster anonymity than Tor.

### **Key Architectural Features**

1.  **SNODEs (Service Nodes)**  
    Staked nodes that provide routing and anonymity.
    
2.  **High-speed Onion Routing Variant**  
    Lower latency compared to Tor.
    
3.  **Exit Functionality**  
    Allows anonymous access to the clearnet.
    
4.  **Onion Services Equivalent**  
    Called “Lokinet SNApps.”
    

### **Use Case**

- real-time online applications needing privacy
    
- voice/video communication
    
- faster anonymous internet routing
    

Lokinet focuses on balancing anonymity with performance.

# **G. Comparative Architecture Analysis (Point-Wise)**

### **1\. Routing Approach**

- **Tor:** onion routing
    
- **I2P:** garlic routing
    
- **Nym:** mixnet w/ batching
    
- **Yggdrasil:** DHT-based encrypted mesh
    
- **Lokinet:** LLARP (low-latency onion routing)
    
- **F2F:** direct trusted P2P connections
    

### **2\. Anonymity Level**

Highest: **Nym**  
High: **Tor**, **I2P**  
Moderate: **Lokinet**  
Low/Variable: **Yggdrasil**  
Social-layer anonymity: **F2F networks**

### **3\. Performance**

Fastest: **Yggdrasil**, **Lokinet**  
Moderate: **Tor**  
Variable: **I2P**  
Slowest: **Nym** (because mixing requires delays)

### **4\. Use Case Focus**

- **Tor:** browser anonymity, hidden websites
    
- **I2P:** internal darknet communities
    
- **Nym:** metadata-resistant communications
    
- **Yggdrasil:** decentralized encrypted networking
    
- **Lokinet:** real-time anonymous routing
    
- **F2F:** private communities

# **H. Why Multiple Hidden Networks Exist**

Each system solves a different privacy problem:

- Tor optimizes **scale and usability**
    
- Nym optimizes **metadata protection**
    
- I2P optimizes **internal darknet resilience**
    
- Lokinet optimizes **speed**
    
- Yggdrasil optimizes **global encrypted addressing**
    
- F2F optimizes **trust boundaries**
    

No single anonymity network can solve all privacy challenges simultaneously — hence the ecosystem diversity.
