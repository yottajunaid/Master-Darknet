title: "1\. Lab Orientation and Operational Boundaries"
---

- ## Scope of Practical Exercises
    
    The scope defines **what students are allowed to do during the lab**.
    
    This training focuses on:
    
    - Observation
        
    - Understanding workflows
        
    - Recognizing risks
        
    - Learning common failure points
        
    
    It does **not** focus on:
    
    - Proving skill
        
    - Pushing boundaries
        
    - Exploring unrelated activities
        
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - The lab has a defined start and end
        
    - Only approved activities are in scope
        
    - Curiosity must stay within boundaries
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Not everything possible is allowed.

    ## Legal Jurisdiction Awareness in Live Environments
    
    Different places have different laws.  
    What is allowed in one country may be restricted in another. During live environments, students are always operating **inside a legal context**, even if the technology feels abstract or global.
    
    The purpose of this topic is **awareness**, not fear.  
    Students should understand that technology does not remove responsibility.
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Laws apply even when using privacy tools
        
    - Location still matters
        
    - “I didn’t know” is not protection
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Using special tools does not remove real-world rules.

    ## Threat Modeling for Trainees
    
    Threat modeling means **thinking ahead about risks**.
    
    In the lab, students are not the threat — they are the **potential target**.  
    This includes:
    
    - Technical risks
        
    - Human mistakes
        
    - Environmental exposure
        
    - Overconfidence
        
    
    The goal is to teach students to ask:
    
    > “What could realistically go wrong here?”
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Assume mistakes will happen
        
    - Humans are usually the weakest point
        
    - Simple actions can have long effects
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Think about risk before it becomes a problem.

    ## Practical Safety Rules and Red Lines
    
    Red lines are actions that are **never crossed** in training.
    
    These rules exist to:
    
    - Protect students
        
    - Protect instructors
        
    - Protect the institution
        
    - Keep the lab ethical and controlled
        
    
    Rules are intentionally simple and strict.  
    If something feels unclear, the correct action is **stop and ask**, not continue.
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - No improvisation outside scope
        
    - No experimenting “just to see”
        
    - No shortcuts
        
    - No ignoring warnings
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    When in doubt, stop.

    ## Lab Infrastructure Overview
    
    This topic explains **what the lab environment includes**, at a high level.
    
    Students should know:
    
    - What systems are being used
        
    - What is controlled
        
    - What is temporary
        
    - What is monitored
        
    
    They do **not** need deep technical detail here.  
    They just need to understand that the lab is **designed**, not random.
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Lab systems are purpose-built
        
    - Not everything behaves like the real world
        
    - The lab is a learning sandbox
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    The lab is controlled on purpose.

    ## Reality Check
    
    Most serious failures in real-world cases happen **before tools are even used**.  
    They happen because people misunderstand scope, ignore boundaries, or assume protection without discipline.
    
    This section exists to prevent that.
