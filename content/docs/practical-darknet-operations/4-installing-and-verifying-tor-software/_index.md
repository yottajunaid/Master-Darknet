- ## Practical Overview
    
    Installing Tor is not just about getting software to run.  
    It is about **trust**—trusting where the software comes from, trusting that it has not been changed, and trusting that it behaves as expected on first use. Many real-world problems start because people rush this step or assume any download is good enough.
    
    This section teaches **how to think about installation**, not how to rush through it.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Official Distribution Sources
    
    Tor software should come **only from official, recognized sources** related to **Tor**.
    
    Why this matters:
    
    - Fake or modified software exists
        
    - Third-party downloads can add hidden risks
        
    - Convenience links are often unsafe
        
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Official source = baseline trust
        
    - Random mirrors reduce trust
        
    - “Looks legit” is not proof
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Where software comes from matters as much as the software itself.

    ## Binary Verification and Integrity Checks
    
    Verification is about confirming that:
    
    - The file is complete
        
    - The file has not been altered
        
    - The file is the one intended by its creators
        
    
    Many users skip this step because:
    
    - It feels technical
        
    - It takes time
        
    - The software “already works”
        
    
    In practice, skipping verification removes the last safety check before use.
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Working software can still be unsafe
        
    - Verification catches silent problems
        
    - Skipping checks is a common mistake
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    If you don’t check it, you’re trusting blindly.

    ## First-Run Configuration Scenarios
    
    The first time Tor runs, it may ask questions or show options.
    
    Important mindset:
    
    - First-run choices shape behavior
        
    - Defaults exist for a reason
        
    - Over-customizing early causes trouble
        
    
    Most beginners get into problems by:
    
    - Clicking quickly
        
    - Enabling things they don’t understand
        
    - Trying to “optimize” too soon
        
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Slow reading beats fast clicking
        
    - Defaults are designed to blend in
        
    - Exploration can wait
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    First run is about stability, not customization.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Network Restriction and Censorship Handling
    
    In some networks, Tor connections may:
    
    - Be slow
        
    - Fail to connect
        
    - Be restricted or filtered
        
    
    This does not mean:
    
    - Tor is broken
        
    - The setup is wrong
        
    - The user made a mistake
        
    
    It means the network environment matters.
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Networks behave differently
        
    - Restrictions are common in some regions
        
    - Connection issues are often external
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Connection problems are often about the network, not you.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Testing Connectivity and Circuit Creation
    
    After installation, the goal is **confirmation**, not exploration.
    
    What confirmation means:
    
    - Tor connects successfully
        
    - A circuit is created
        
    - The system shows normal behavior
        
    
    This is not the time to:
    
    - Browse widely
        
    - Log in
        
    - Download content
        
    
    Testing is about **seeing that things work**, not using them heavily.
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Test first, use later
        
    - One success is enough
        
    - Avoid unnecessary activity
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Confirm it works, then stop.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Reality Check
    
    In real investigations and audits, compromised or fake software is a recurring issue.  
    Most of these cases did not involve advanced attacks—they involved **skipped checks and rushed installs**.
    
    This section exists to slow that down.
