- ## Practical Overview
    
    Tor Browser is not a normal browser with extra privacy added.  
    It is a **controlled environment** designed to make many users look similar. Most problems happen when people try to use it like Chrome or Firefox, or when they try to “improve” it without understanding why it was designed the way it is.
    
    This section teaches **how to think while using the browser**, not how to customize it.

    ## Browser Interface and Security Levels
    
    The Tor Browser interface looks simple on purpose.  
    Behind that simplicity are security controls that balance **usability and protection**.
    
    Security levels exist to:
    
    - Reduce risky features
        
    - Limit how websites interact with the browser
        
    - Prevent silent tracking
        
    
    Changing levels affects:
    
    - Website behavior
        
    - Media playback
        
    - Scripts and features
        
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Defaults are intentional
        
    - Higher security may break sites
        
    - Changing settings changes behavior patterns
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    The browser looks simple because complexity creates risk.

    ## JavaScript Control in Practice
    
    JavaScript allows websites to be interactive.  
    It also allows websites to **observe behavior**.
    
    In Tor Browser:
    
    - JavaScript is controlled, not fully open
        
    - Security levels affect how much runs
        
    
    Important understanding:
    
    - Many sites rely on JavaScript
        
    - Disabling too much can make sites unusable
        
    - Enabling too much increases exposure
        
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - JavaScript is both useful and risky
        
    - Broken sites are sometimes expected
        
    - Functionality trades against safety
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    More features usually mean more risk.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Tabs, Sessions, and Identity Rotation
    
    Each browsing session creates a **temporary identity**.  
    Tabs within a session share context unless reset.
    
    Important behaviors:
    
    - Opening many tabs increases complexity
        
    - Long sessions create patterns
        
    - Identity changes reset context
        
    
    Good practice is not about paranoia—it is about **clarity**.
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Fewer tabs are safer
        
    - Shorter sessions reduce patterns
        
    - Identity reset breaks continuity
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Long, busy sessions are harder to keep clean.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Safe vs Unsafe Browser Behaviors
    
    Safe behavior is usually **boring behavior**.
    
    Safer habits include:
    
    - Reading more than clicking
        
    - Staying on fewer sites
        
    - Avoiding downloads
        
    - Avoiding logins
        
    
    Risky behavior includes:
    
    - Clicking everything out of curiosity
        
    - Installing add-ons
        
    - Logging into known accounts
        
    - Downloading unknown files
        
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Curiosity increases exposure
        
    - Downloads are high-risk
        
    - Logins connect identity
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    If it feels like normal browsing, it’s probably risky.

    ## Common User Mistakes Observed in the Wild
    
    Most mistakes are repeated again and again:
    
    - Treating Tor Browser like a daily browser
        
    - Customizing appearance or settings
        
    - Leaving sessions open for hours
        
    - Mixing anonymous and personal activity
        
    - Assuming “Tor = safe no matter what”
        
    
    These mistakes usually happen slowly, not instantly.
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Overconfidence causes most failures
        
    - Small habits create big patterns
        
    - Mistakes compound over time
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Most failures are habits, not hacks.
    
    * * *
    
    ## Reality Check
    
    In real-world cases, Tor Browser itself is rarely the failure point.  
    Failures happen because users **forget why the browser exists** and start using it for convenience instead of caution.
    
    This section exists to correct that mindset early.
