title: "7\. Onion Link Discovery and Validation"
---

- ## Practical Overview
    
    Finding onion links is not difficult; **deciding which links deserve attention is**.  
    Onion networks contain many copies, outdated addresses, and intentionally misleading sites. This section teaches trainees to **slow down and validate**, rather than to collect links quickly.
    
    The goal is to understand **how legitimate services usually look and behave**, and how fake ones try to imitate them.

    ## Link Directories and Aggregators
    
    Directories and aggregators collect onion links in one place.  
    They are useful as **starting points**, not as sources of truth.
    
    Important realities:
    
    - Many directories are outdated
        
    - Some are poorly maintained
        
    - Some list anything without checks
        
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Directories are reference lists, not endorsements
        
    - Old entries are common
        
    - Presence in a directory does not equal legitimacy
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    A directory shows what existed, not what is safe.

    ## Community-Shared Onion Lists
    
    Some onion links are shared through forums, chats, or communities.  
    These lists often feel more trustworthy because they come from people, not machines.
    
    However:
    
    - Communities have different standards
        
    - Trust varies by group
        
    - Lists can be copied and reused without updates
        
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Community trust is contextual
        
    - Old lists circulate for years
        
    - Human sharing does not remove risk
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    People can share bad links without bad intent.

    ## Signature Indicators of Legitimate Services
    
    Legitimate onion services often show **consistency**, not polish.
    
    Common indicators include:
    
    - Stable structure across visits
        
    - Clear navigation
        
    - Calm language
        
    - No pressure to act quickly
        
    
    Legitimacy is about **behavior over time**, not first impressions.
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Consistency matters more than design
        
    - Calm tone is a good sign
        
    - Urgency is a warning
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    Real services don’t rush you.

    ## Clone, Scam, and Phishing Site Patterns
    
    Fake onion sites often:
    
    - Copy logos and layouts
        
    - Use similar names or addresses
        
    - Ask for sensitive input early
        
    - Create urgency or fear
        
    
    These sites rely on:
    
    - Familiarity
        
    - Speed
        
    - User inattention
        
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Visual similarity means nothing
        
    - Early requests are suspicious
        
    - Pressure is a red flag
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    If a site pushes you, it’s probably pushing you off a cliff.

    ## Onion URL Versioning Issues
    
    Onion addresses change over time due to:
    
    - Security updates
        
    - Service migrations
        
    - Operator decisions
        
    
    As a result:
    
    - Old addresses may stop working
        
    - Multiple versions may exist
        
    - Fake sites may reuse old formats
        
    
    This makes **address accuracy critical**.
    
    ### Practical anchors:
    
    - Old addresses often linger online
        
    - Multiple versions cause confusion
        
    - Exact address matching matters
        
    
    **Simple idea:**  
    One wrong character can send you somewhere else.

    ## Reality Check
    
    Most onion-related mistakes come from **trusting appearance instead of behavior**.  
    Users often assume that if something loads and looks familiar, it must be real. That assumption is heavily exploited.
    
    This section exists to break that habit.
